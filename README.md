# Election Dapp Project

## Description

This is a dapp project that most beginner blockchain developers make. It is a dapp(Decentralized Application) that uses a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain to run the back end for the election. By using the ethereum blockchain users don't have to trust an api to count and secure their vote. All the data is saved on the blockchain which isn't hackable. The app also uses react native to provide a front end for the dapp.

Within the project I made the smart contract for the election. Then I wrote the code for the test. The test covers areas that make sure that the smart contract is working properly. Like when the user makes a vote the cadidate recieves it. Also making sure that uses can't vote after the polls are closed.
