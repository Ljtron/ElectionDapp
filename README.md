# Election Dapp Project

## Description

This is a dapp project that most beginner blockchain developers make. It is a dapp(Decentralized Application) that uses a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain to run the back end for the election. By using the ethereum blockchain users don't have to trust an api to count and secure their vote. All the data is saved on the blockchain which isn't hackable. The app also uses react native to provide a front end for the dapp.
